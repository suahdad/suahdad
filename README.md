Hi I'm Jaspher (_yes with an h, i'm filipino btw_)

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate that went to become a Software Engineer currently working for [Manulife](https://www.manulife.com.ph/).
I'm still incorporating those engineering methods and principles in what I do, and I'm still learning.

I'm an all around guy and learning interesting things is what i want, Going the extra mile to practice what i learn, and also preach what I developed over time.
